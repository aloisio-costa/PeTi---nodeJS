# PeTiJS
This is a project I put together at the same time as I was taking the Wed Dev Bootcamp course.

# What is it? 
PeTi is a "Uber" of pet services. A simple prototype website which the goal is to connect people who are 
looking for someone to take care of their pet/s with people who are willing to do so.
